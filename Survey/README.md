This study, ‘An Empirical Study of Data Visualisation’ aims to explore the use and implementation of data visualisation as a tool for understanding data. The survey will ask participants subjective questions regarding a series of data visualisations to assess how making various modifications to a ‘control’ plot impacts what is inferred about the data. The survey will involve optional demographics questions, as listed below. These have all been deemed to potentially have an impact on interpretation of visualisations. These are being asked both to analyse any potential significant impacts as well as potentially explain outlying results.
•	‘Please enter your age’

•	‘If you are a university student or past university graduate please specify your area of study’ – Depending on their area of a study, a participant may have had more exposure of training surrounding data visualisations.

•	The following are ranked on a 5-point Likert scale from ‘Strongly Disagree’ to ‘Strongly Agree’:
•	‘I have good spatial awareness skills’ 
•	‘I have good observational skills’ 
•	‘I have good numerical skills’ 

•	‘Are you colourblind?’ – To assess whether being colourblind impacts colour preference or interpretating visualisations.

•	‘Do you have any disorders that may affect visual processing? (this could be a general visual processing disorder or dyslexia, dyscalculia etc)’ – Any visual processing disorder could impact on interpreting visualisations.
