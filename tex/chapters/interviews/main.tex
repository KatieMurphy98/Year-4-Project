% TODO decide which parts of code to show, because whole code is pretty long. Send scripts in advance? Could potentially 
% show the d3 code for the basic barplot -> show basic barplot codes for all three, and then go more in depth for R and Py.

Structure: Display data post manipulation and explain all variables.

Potential Questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do you feel you have a personal bias towards either of these languages?
    \item Do you have any initial comments regarding this code?
    \item Which code do you feel is more efficient? Why? % Note whether these are because of the language or because of me
    \item Do you feel the code could be made more efficient? If so how?
    \item Which do you feel seems more intuitive? (Note that bias will probably play a role here)
    \item Do you feel that either language provides more opportinity to modify small plot attributes? %TODO Will word this way better, but this is the general idea of the question
    \item Which do you feel seems more labour intensive? (Note my R bias and others' Py bias)
\end{itemize}
