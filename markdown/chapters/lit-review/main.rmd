\chapter{Coding of Visualisations}

This chapter will discuss the programming behind the visualisations presented in the surveys, and present results of interviews discussing the opinions of programming specialists in relation to the codes. As previously discussed, two languages were used to create the plots; R and Python. Initially, the JavaScript D3 library was also considered, but discounted due to time constraints. The D3 library will, however, be briefly discussed here. The previous literature review discussed the overall theory behind the design of visualisation, but an additional brief review of literature regarding coding for visualisations will be undertaken here.


\section{A Brief Review of Literature}
In @wilke2019, the author discusses how to choose the right visualisation software, exploring the areas of 'Reproducibility and Repeatability', 'Data exploration versus data presentation', and 'Separation of content and design'. He starts off by remarking that a person will tend to lean into producing visuals in their already preferred tools, and he mentions the 'strong emotional bond' one may have to their preferred tool. This is discussed as a not necessarily a negative concept, since the process of training to use a new tool can be time-consuming and mentally taxing, with the end thus results potentially not being as accomplished or polished as if the individual had spent the same time and effort creating the visual with the tool they know. This factor may be assessed on a case-by-case basis; if the preferred tool provides adequate results then this may be favoured as more time and energy can be put into creating the graphic itself as opposed to learning a new tool, however if another tool performs the given task remarkably better than the preferred, then it should be at least considered in the visual design process. This will be investigated in the interviews, as there is roughly a 50/50 split between respondents preferring R, and those favouring Python, and so it will be interesting to see if this impacts opinions on the tool used to create the visuals.

The author states that \textit{'The best visualization software is the one that allows you to make the figures you need'}, meaning that if the old tool allows a user to produce visuals better than leaning a new one, even though the new may be better suited, it would be preferable to choose whichever allows the needed figures to be created for the individual. However, he then goes on to explain the benefits of having the knowledge of many tools in an arsenal, as this can allow the user to make an informed decision on the best tool for the job, much like an engineer with a tool box. 

The definitions of 'reproducability' and 'repeatability' used by Wilke closely mirror those used in investigative science; 'reproducability' is the ability of the visualisation to be re-created by another user with access to the data, and 'repeatabiity' is the ability of the visualisation to be exactly replicated by the original creator. It is important to note here that Wilke remarks that a 'reproducible' visualisation does not need to be identical to the original in terms of aesthetics, but the content of the plot should be the same. Wilke does, however, state that the 'repeatable' graphics should be able to be identical every time they are created. 

One conclusion Wilke draws is that less programmatic and more interactive tools, for example Tableau [@tableau] or Spotfire [@spotfire], may reduce the reproducibility of visualisations as a result of the live visualisation editing with more limited active change tracking. The lack of change tracking can lead the original creator of a visual to forget what alterations have been made between a start and finish product if a manual effort to track changes is not made, resulting in neither the original creator nor another individual being able to replicate or reproduce the visualisation easily. The author even states that he tries to \textit{'stay away from interactive programs as much as possible'}, as programmatic methods, for which data and scripts may be easily shared, lend themselves much more to reproduction and replication. 

There are benefits to interactive plotting tools, however, as discussed by @LUO2019113061. Such tools are beneficial for presenting data in a way that allows audience questions or queries regarding the data to be investigated and answered in real time, as opposed to programmatic methods, which are fairly fixed during presentation, with modifications involving altering and re-running the underlying code. Programmatic methods, in this way, can be more time consuming and less flexible.

A tool of an interactive nature allows the user to closely follow the aforementioned \textit{'Visual Information Seeking Mantra'}, as they are able to actively control the depth and complexity of information being presented, once again in real time. As well as for presentations, an interactive format is useful for data exploration, perhaps for discovering patterns and connections as a precursor to creating similar visuals using a programming tool. Interactive tools allow the user to filter, sort and really drill down into the data with a few clicks, as opposed to having to re-run many lines of code every time an alteration is made.

Whether to choose an interactive tool or not depends heavily on the goal of the visualisation, and the medium with which it is being presented. For example, static, programmatic visuals, would be ideal for a scientific research paper, but a pharmaceutical representative presenting study data to healthcare professionals may benefit from the abilities of an interactive tool.
